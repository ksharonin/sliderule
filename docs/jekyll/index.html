intro:
- excerpt: '___SlideRule___ is a server-side framework implemented in C++/Lua that provides REST APIs for processing science data and returning results. This enables researchers and other data systems to have low-latency access to generated data products using processing parameters supplied at the time of the request.  _SlideRule_ runs in AWS us-west-2 and has access to ICESat-2, GEDI, Landsat, and ArcticDEM datasets stored in S3. While its web services can be accessed by any http client (e.g. curl), a [Python client](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule/sliderule-python) is provided that makes it easier to interact with _SlideRule_.'
