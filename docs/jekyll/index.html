intro:
- excerpt: '___SlideRule___ is a public web service with REST APIs for processing science data and returning results. It provides researchers and other data systems with low-latency access to generated data products using processing parameters supplied at the time of the request.  _SlideRule_ runs in AWS us-west-2 and has access to ICESat-2, GEDI, Landsat, and a growing list of other datasets stored in S3. While its web services can be accessed by any http client (e.g. curl), [Python](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule/sliderule) and [Node.js](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule/sliderule) clients are provided to make it easier to interact with _SlideRule_.'
