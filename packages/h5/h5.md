## Install HDF5 Library

To download the latest release, go to https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/ and download the source tar.gz file.

Make sure zlib is installed:
```bash
$ sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
```

Unpack and build the release:
```bash
$ tar -xvzf hdf5-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ mkdir hdf5-build
$ cd hdf5-build
$ CFLAGS=-fPIC ../hdf5-x.y.z/configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-shared --enable-build-mode=debug --enable-cxx
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

The compile options above were for the following reasons:
* static linking reduces system dependencies when installing the sliderule executable (e.g. docker)
* -fPIC is needed so that the static library can be included in a dynamic library (if necessary)

## Install REST-VOL Plugin

Once the HDF5 library is built and installed, the HDF5 REST VOL plugin must be downloaded, built, and installed.

Make sure that the curl library development files are installed on your system:
```bash
$ sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Download and install the Yet Another JSON Library (go to https://lloyd.github.io/yajl/ and download the `yajl-2.1.0.tar.gz` compressed tarball).
```bash
$ tar -xvzf lloyd-yajl-2.1.0-0-ga0ecdde.tar.gz # note filename may vary
$ cd lloyd-yajl-66cb08c # note directory name may vary
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To download the latest source and switch to the latest branch (which is necessary in order to work with HDF5 1.12 and later)
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:HDFGroup/vol-rest.git
$ cd rest
$ git checkout hdf5_1_12_update
```

Build and install the REST VOL plugin using the previously built HDF5 library:
```bash
$ ./build_vol_cmake.sh -H /usr/local -P /usr/local
$ cd rest_vol_cmake_build_files/
$ sudo make install
```
