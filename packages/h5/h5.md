## Install HDF5 Library

To download the latest release, go to https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/ and download the source tar.gz file.

Make sure zlib is installed:
```bash
$ sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
```

Unpack and build the release:
```bash
$ tar -xvzf hdf5-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ mkdir hdf5-build
$ cd hdf5-build
$ CFLAGS=-fPIC ../hdf5-x.y.z/configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-shared --enable-build-mode=debug --enable-cxx
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

The compile options above were for the following reasons:
* static linking reduces system dependencies when installing the sliderule executable (e.g. docker)
* -fPIC is needed so that the static library can be included in a dynamic library (if necessary)

## Install REST-VOL Plugin


sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
